# elm-game-essentials

This package includes essentials that are useful for creating games.

It shares design philosophies from [Orasund/pixelEngine](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Orasund/pixelengine/latest/),
but its not required to use both.

# Future of this Repos

Right know I don't know where this package might head to.

It might be the starting ground to various smaller packages or evolve into a
backbone for the pixelEngine.
